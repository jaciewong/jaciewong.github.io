                <h2>Why We Sleep</h2>
                <p>Sleep is essential for our overall well-being, playing a crucial role in maintaining both our body
                    and mind.<br>We sleep not just to rest, but because it supports many important functions that keep
                    us healthy and functioning well.
                </p>
            </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Physical Health</h3>
                        <p>While we sleep, our body gets to work repairing muscles, tissues, and even boosting the
                            immune system. It’s also when growth hormones are released, which is especially important
                            for younger people. Without enough sleep, we may feel physically weak, slow to heal,
                            or more likely to get sick.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Brain Function</h3>
                        <p>Sleep gives our brain time to sort through what we’ve learned during the day. It helps
                            strengthen
                            memory, supports learning, and clears out waste products—like beta-amyloid, a protein that
                            can
                            build
                            up and affect memory if not removed. That’s why we often feel foggy or forgetful when we
                            don’t
                            get
                            enough rest.</p>

                        <h3>Emotional Health</h3>
                        <p>Getting enough sleep helps us stay calm and handle stress better. It allows the brain to
                            regulate
                            emotions and respond more clearly to situations, making it easier to stay balanced during
                            the
                            day.
                            Without enough rest, the brain’s emotional control weakens, which can make us feel
                            irritable,
                            anxious, or even sad without a clear reason.</p>
